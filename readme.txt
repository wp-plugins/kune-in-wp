This is a plugin to embed docs from kune.cc (and similar nodes) in Wordpress pages. Also will allow to use other kune functionalities in Wordpress. 

== Description ==

This is a plugin to embed docs from kune.cc (and similar nodes) in Wordpress pages. Also will allow to use other kune functionalities in Wordpress. Just add a kune document with shorcodes like `[kune url='http://kune.cc/#!somegroup.docs.1.2']`.

As kune documents are powered by Apache Wave you can embed documents edited in real-time collaboratively.

Inspired in the previous Wave Wavr plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wavr/.
