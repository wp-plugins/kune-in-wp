This is a plugin to embed docs from kune.cc (and similar nodes) in Wordpress pages. Also it will allow to use other kune functionalities in Wordpress. 

== Description ==

This is a plugin to embed docs from kune.cc (and similar nodes) in Wordpress pages. Also it will allow to use other kune functionalities in Wordpress (like our [gtalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtalk) compatible chat). 

Just add a kune document with shorcodes like:

`[kune url='http://kune.cc/#!somegroup.docs.1.2']`

As kune documents are powered by [Apache Wave](http://incubator.apache.org/wave/) you can embed documents edited in real-time collaboratively.

This plugin is inspired in the previous [Wave Wavr plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wavr/).

`[kune url='http://kune.cc/#!somegroup.docs.1.2']`

Also there is an editor button to include this shortcodes.
